# Project #: P1

* Author: Laura Loughmiller Sterling Loughmiller
* Class: CS361 section 1/2
* Semester: Spring 2024

## Overview

A java program that recreates the behavior of a deterministic finitc automaton (DFA).

## Reflection

I think the program went well over all. I've done worse projects (scheme, b-trees). The write up was helpful. I wish we could could walk through the project during class, like a small demo of something adjacent to it. It's a bit nerve wracking tackling a new concept without direct examples but I suppose the training wheels have to come off sometime. It was a bit challenging to come up with all the tests to cover the mysterious 11 test cases that will also be used during grading. I'm never a fan of not knowing what/how it's going to be tested. 
Techniques that made the code easier to debug was working in small chunks. One method at a time, things like that. I'm not sure what I would change about the design process, really getting those initial six test cases to pass was the easiest part of the assignment. It was plunging into the unknown that was awful. Using onyx is alwasy a bummer too; it's never as nice to me as github classroom is. If I could go back in time...well first I want to see what I get on this assignment and then I would go back in time and tell myself which tests to handle. 

## Compiling and Using

This section should tell the user how to compile your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. Does your
program require user input? If so, what does your user need to know
about it to use it as quickly as possible?

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
